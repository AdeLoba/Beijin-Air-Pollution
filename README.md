# Beijin-Air-Pollution
This data set includes hourly air pollutants data from 12 nationally-controlled air-quality monitoring sites. The air-quality data are from the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center. The meteorological data in each air-quality site are matched with the nearest weather station from the China Meteorological Administration.

This comprehensive project analyzes Beijing's air quality data (2013-2017) to understand pollution patterns, assess health impacts, and provide evidence-based policy recommendations for emission controls.This project aims to provide the city council with evidence to justify stricter emission controls and understand air pollution's public health implications.

## Project Objectives
- Identify strong seasonal and daily pollution patterns
- Assess health risks for sensitive populations
- Forecast bad air days with 85% accuracy
- Optimize monitoring station placement
- Provide cost-benefit analysis for interventions
